To use this package, start Sage with the .sage files from this package in your
working directory. Then type::

    sage: from recip import *

This file implements some basic functions: base change for matrices and
uniformizers of ideals.

from sage.matrix.constructor import Matrix


def mat_convert(M, ring_or_map):
    r"""
    Applies `ring_or_map` to the coefficients of M,
    i.e. given M = (m_ij)_ij, returns
    (ring_or_map(m_ij))_ij
    
    EXAMPLES::
    
        sage: from recip import *
        sage: M = Matrix([[1/2, 1/5], [7, 9/2]])
        sage: mat_convert(M, floor)
        [0 0]
        [7 4]
        sage: mat_convert(M, GF(3))
        [2 2]
        [1 0]
    r"""
    return Matrix([[ring_or_map(M[i,j]) for j in range(M.ncols())] for i in range(M.nrows())])


def uniformizer(p):
    r"""
    Given a prime ideal p, returns a uniformizer.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from recip import *
        sage: P = QuadraticField(-5,'a').ideal(5).factor()[0][0]
        sage: uniformizer(P)
        a
    r"""
    for pi in p.gens():
        if pi.valuation(p) == 1:
            return pi


def lift_small(a):
    r"""
    Given a in Z/muZ, output b in ZZ with |b| <= mu/2 and (b mod mu) = a.
    Given a in Z, output a.
    
    EXAMPLES::
    
        sage: from recip import *
        sage: lift_small(Zmod(8)(7))
        -1
        sage: lift_small(Zmod(7)(10))

        sage: lift_small(Zmod(12)(20))
        -4
        sage: lift_small(-501)
        -501
        sage: lift_small(QQ(7))     
        7
    r"""
